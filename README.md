The goal of this project is to develop a content-based recommender system for Netflix TV shows and movies.
The genres and descriptions of the titles will be used to make recommendations.
The dataset includes information about titles such as name, genres, description, release year, and scores.
This project involves data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.
The model building and training leverages TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend similar titles'''
